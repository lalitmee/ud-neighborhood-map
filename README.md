## Neigborhood map / project 8 by udacity
This project is part of the Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity. It is a single page map application made with React and the Google Maps API.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 

The map and its components were rendered using [react-google-maps](https://tomchentw.github.io/react-google-maps/).

Images on each location is provided by [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/developers) API.

## Getting started
In the project directory, you can run:

Clone the current repository

`npm install`

`npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

`npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the build folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.

The service worker is only enabled in the production environment, e.g. the output of `npm run build`.
