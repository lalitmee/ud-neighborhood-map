## ud-neighborhood-map

This project is part of the Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Program by Udacity. It is a single page map application made with React and the Google Maps API. In this SPA I have made a list of some places of India and those places will be marked when you will start the application.

- [Built With](https://github.com/lalitmee/ud-neighborhood-map#built-with)

### Installing and Running

Follow the following steps to start the application in your browser

```
git clone https://github.com/lalitmee/ud-neighborhood-map.git
cd ud-neighborhood-map
npm install
npm start
```

These steps will start your application on the port [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) where you can play with the app.

- **Service Worker:** One most important thing about service workers that we enable the service workers for only the production mode not for development mode otherwise development of the application will take a lot of time because then we have to unregister the service worker and all.

### What and Why

This is an application in which I have added some cool places of India to visit or you can say when I have visited except Amritsar. So, when you will open the application in your browser after following above steps which are mentioned in [Installing and Running](https://github.com/lalitmee/ud-neighborhood-map#installing-and-running), you will be able to see a Google maps with some place markers. Those are the places which I have listed. There is a sidebar on the right and if you will click on any place name in the sidebar you can see some pictures related to that place. I hope that those pictures will change after sometime. Thanks for you time to reach out here.
